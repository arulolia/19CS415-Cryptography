EX: 6 IMPLEMENTATION OF PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATION 

AIM:
To Implement Pseudorandom Number Generation Using Standard library.


ALGORITHM:

1.	Start the program and import the required libraries.
2.	Seed the random number generator using the current time (i.e) rand(time(0));
3.	Get the number of random numbers to generate.
4.	Pass the value for number of iterations and print the numbers.
5.	End the program.


PROGRAM:

OUTPUT:

RESULT:The Implementation of Pseudorandom Number Generation Using Standard library is successful.
