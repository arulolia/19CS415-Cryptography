EX : 5 IMPLEMENTATION OF RAIL FENCE CIPHER

AIM:

To develop a simple C program to implement Rail Fence Cipher.


ALGORITHM:
1.	To perform the Encryption Process
•	Input the plaintext string from the user.
•	Calculate the length of the plaintext.
•	Create the ciphertext using two rails:
a.	First, collect characters at even indices (i.e., 0, 2, 4, …).

b.	Then, collect characters at odd indices (i.e., 1, 3, 5, …).

c.	Combine both parts to form the ciphertext.

•	Display the encrypted ciphertext.
2.	To perform the Decryption Process:

•	Calculate the length of the ciphertext.
•	Find the midpoint:
◦	a. If the length is even, midpoint = length / 2.
◦	b. If the length is odd, midpoint = (length / 2) + 1.
•	Reconstruct the original message:
a.	Take the first half as characters from even positions.

b.	Take the second half as characters from odd positions.

c.	Merge both using alternating positions.

3.	Display the decrypted plaintext.
