EX 11 : IMPLEMENTATION OF ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC)

AIM:

To implement the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm for basic point addition and scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve over a finite field.


ALGORITHM:
1.	Start the program.
2.	Select the parameters of the elliptic curve:
•	Choose a prime number p (field size).
•	Choose curve parameters a and b for the equation:
y2 = x3 + ax + b modp
2.	Define a base point (generator) G(x, y) on the curve.
3.	Choose private keys:
•	User A chooses a random private key a.
•	User B chooses a random private key b.
4.	Compute public keys:
•	User A computes public key A = a * G (scalar multiplication).
•	User B computes public key B = b * G.
5.	Exchange public keys.
6.	Each user computes the shared secret:
•	User A computes: S = a * B
•	User B computes: S = b * A
•	Since ECC is based on scalar multiplication, both S values are equal.
7.	The shared secret is now established.
8.	End the program.

RESULT:

The ECC program successfully demonstrates point addition and scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve over a finite field, and the simulation has been executed and verified successfully.
