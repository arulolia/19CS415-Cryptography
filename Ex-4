EXP : 4 IMPLEMENTATION OFVIGENERE CIPHER

AIM :
To develop a simple C program to implement Vigenere Cipher.
DESIGN STEPS :
Step 1 :
Design of Vigenere Cipher algorithnm
Step 2 :
Implementation using C or pyhton code
Step 3 :
1.	The Vigenère cipher uses a series of Caesar ciphers based on letters from a repeating keyword to encrypt text.
2.	A Vigenère square or table is created with 26 rows of the alphabet, each shifted one position left, representing different Caesar cipher shifts.
3.	To encrypt, each letter of the plaintext is matched with a corresponding letter in the keyword, repeated to match the message length.
4.	The letter in the Vigenère table is selected by intersecting the row starting with the keyword letter and the column with the plaintext letter.
5.	The resulting encrypted text is a combination of letters taken from various rows of the Vigenère square, based on the keyword.
6.	Decryption reverses this process by identifying the original plaintext letter from the appropriate row based on the keyword letter.
