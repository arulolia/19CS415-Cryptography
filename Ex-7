EX 7 : IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DES

AIM:

To implement the working of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) using a simplified XOR-based encryption and decryption method in C programming.

ALGORITHM:
To Perform Encryption:
1.	Start the program.
2.	Accept the plaintext message and encryption key from the user.
3.	Calculate the length of the message.
4.	For each character in the message:

•	XOR the character with the corresponding character in the key.

•	If the key is shorter than the message, repeat the key using key[i % keyLength].

•	Store the result in the encrypted message array.

5.	Null-terminate the encrypted message string.

6.	Display the encrypted message in hexadecimal format.

To Perform Decryption:
7.	For each character in the encrypted message:

•	XOR it with the same corresponding character from the key.

•	This reverses the XOR operation, retrieving the original character.

8.	Null-terminate the decrypted message string.

9.	Display the decrypted message.

10.	End the program.
