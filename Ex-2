EXP : 2 IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAY FAIR CIPHER


AIM :
To implement a program to encrypt a plain text and decrypt a cipher text using play fair Cipher substitution technique.


ALGORITHM:
1.	To perform Encryption :
•	Preprocess the key:
a.	Convert the key to lowercase.
b.	Remove spaces and duplicate letters.
c.	Replace 'j' with 'i'.
2.	Generate the 5×5 key matrix (key table):
a.	Fill in the unique characters of the key.
b.	Fill the remaining cells with unused letters of the alphabet (except 'j').
3.	Preprocess the plaintext:
a.	Convert to lowercase.
b.	Remove spaces.
c.	Replace 'j' with 'i'.
d.	Break into digraphs (pairs of two letters).
If a pair has two same letters, insert 'x' between them.
If there's a single letter left at the end, add a padding letter (like 'z').
4.	Encrypt each digraph using these rules:
a.	Same row: Replace each letter with the letter to its right (wrap to start if needed).
b.	Same column: Replace each letter with the letter below it (wrap to top if needed).
c.	Different row and column: Swap the column positions of the two letters.
5.	Display the encrypted ciphertext.
6.	To perform Decryption:
•	Preprocess the ciphertext like the encryption step.
•	Decrypt each digraph using these rules:
a.	Same row: Replace each letter with the letter to its left (wrap to end if needed).

b.	Same column: Replace each letter with the letter above it (wrap to bottom if needed).

c.	Different row and column: Swap the column positions of the two letters.

7.	Display the decrypted plaintext.
